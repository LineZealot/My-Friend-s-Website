            I have once believed that in order to truly know a topic you must have first 
            experienced it yourself. As I often say, “I am a man of my experiences”. 

            I was born in a country where I had no opportunity for success. My wonderful, 
            loving parents chose to adopt my sister and I and have given me the freedom and 
            opportunity for achievement. 

            Living in such circumstances has granted me the ability of free thought, whether it be a 
            good or not so good thing, I share my thoughts in hopes of provoking thought. 

            Any free thinking, not manufactured or coerced by external influence.
